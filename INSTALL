Install/Uninstall instruction for the glFusion Custom Profile plugin.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

You may upload and install the archive file to your site via the plugin 
administration interface in glFusion.  This is the recommended method.


MANUAL INSTALLATION

Step 1:  Back up your GLFusion Database.  The profile plugin adds tables 
to your GLFusion database. You can do this with the built in admin backup 
facility.

Step 2:  Uncompress the profile plugin archive while in the 
<glfusion_private_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will create a 
directory called profile in the plugins directory.

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html 
directory (usually public_html) create a directory called profile.  
Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called profile.

Step 4:  Change to your <glfusion_private_dir>/plugins/profile/ directory.  
Copy the files in the admin directory to the admin/plugins/profile/ directory 
that you created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the public_html 
directory to the public_html/profile/ directory that you created in step 3.

Step 5:  Log in to your GLFusion as a root user, chose Plugins from Admin 
Block. You will see the new plugin awaiting installation. Click Install. 
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  
If not examine glFusion system error log for possible problems.

Step 6:  (glFusion 1.1.6 and earlier only) 
Enable custom registration and customize your templates and 
lib-custom.php.  Although glFusion 1.1.5 has added additional methods 
for plugins to interact with the user, a few areas still require manual 
configuration.  Refer to the sample templates and lib-custom.php files in 
the <plugin_dir>/custom directory.

If you have already modified lib-custom.php with a CUSTOM_userForm() function,
then just add the sample section between "BEGIN PROFILE PLUGIN" and 
"END PROFILE PLUGIN", and modify your custom memberdetail.thtml file 
accordingly.


The profile plugin should now be installed and functioning.  
Clicking on the profile icon in Command & Control, or from the Admin menu, 
will take you to the admin page where you can add your own custom profile 
fields.

From the "Account Settings" link, you should see a new tab labelled "Custom
Profile", from which you can edit your user data.



UPGRADING (Manual):

Perform the same steps as for a new installation.


UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  Go to Admin Block/Plugins. Find the plugin in the list of plugins, 
click the edit icon. Then press Delete and confirm (or not) the deletion.
This will remove all the plugin data from your database.

Step 2:  Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:
    <private_dir>/plugins/profile/
    <public_html>/profile/
    <public_html>/admin/plugins/profile/

Thats it.
