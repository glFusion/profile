Custom Profile plugin for glFusion
Release 1.1.4

The Custom Profile plugin for glFusion allows the administrator to create 
custom profile elements for user acccounts. Prevously, this required 
significant cusom programming and template modification.

This plugin requires the LGLib plugin for message handling and other
functions. To enable messages to the user, add
    {lglib_messages}
shortly after the <body> tag in {layout_dir}/header.thtml. This is where
alerts about missing or invalid field data will be displayed.
